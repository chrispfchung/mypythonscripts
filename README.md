# My Python Scripts
I like creating scripts that minimizes the length of certain tasks or just enhances it in general.
When I have some time I will work on these ideas and put them into this repo. I'd like to have a collection of scripts that serve my needs whether it is for coding practice or for practical use and hopefully serve a function for a user.
